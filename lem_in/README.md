## push_swap tester

To test your push_swap project, you can use the following script :

```bash
./tester.sh
```

To test the script you'll need several things :
- A `lem_in` executable
- And of course, the `tester.sh` script

The script auto-gen maps and test them with your executable. If it fails, it will give you a path were you can find your output and the expected output.
