## antman tester

To test your antman project, you can use the following script :

```bash
./tester.sh
```

To test the script you'll need several things :
- A `antman` executable
- Files containing the input of the antman program
- And of course, the `tester.sh` script
- The Files folder containing the files to compress/decompress
