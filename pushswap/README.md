## push_swap tester

To test your push_swap project, you can use the following script :

```bash
./tester.sh
```

To test the script you'll need several things :
- A `push_swap` executable
- The given `solver.py` script
- Files containing the input of the push_swap program
- And of course, the `tester.sh` script

#### The files are formatted like [this](files/intermediate_07_unsorted_list_positive_numbers_2)
