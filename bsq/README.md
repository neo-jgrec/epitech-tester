## bsq tester

To test your push_swap project, you can use the following script :

```bash
./tester.sh
```

To test the script you'll need several things :
- A `bsq` executable
- `mouli_maps` folder with the maps
- `mouli_maps_solved` folder with the solved maps
- And of course, the `tester.sh` script

#### The files are formatted like [this](mouli_maps/intermediate_map_34_137_with_obstacles_50pc)
