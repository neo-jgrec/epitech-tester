## corewar tester

To test the asm of your corewar project, you can use the following script :

```bash
./asm/tester.sh <asm_executable> <asm_binary> <asm_test_binary>
```

To test the script you'll need several things :
- Your `asm` binary
- The `asm` binary give by the subject
- Champions (*.s) in the `./asm/champions` directory
- And of course, the `./asm/tester.sh` script

You can edit the tester file to add more tests.
